    gatsby new my-new-website https://github.com/georgewilde/gatsby-starter-wilde-creations
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new site’s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd my-new-website
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `https://localhost:8000`!
